                        A first-hand experience to make you feel less of a guest and more of a sailor/friend/partner/adventurer. I will go out of my way to justify the reason for the chosen route. I am equally experienced with working on different types of boats as well as working with groups, individuals and honeymooners. My personal preference is catamaran and my second name is teamwork. I will do my best to give suggestions of nightlife or isolated evenings on the best locations if asked for. I am well acquainted with the locals to provide the best of both worlds.</p>

                        I will be your clear-headed, logical type of skipper. I have sailed overseas and in my homeland, a hard-working, dedicated team member with years of experience down the line. True dedication, as well as work ethics, is what made me grow as a skipper in this line of work. I spend most of the year living on the island and can give you first-hand experience of local food and customs. Together we'll be chasing those sunsets and crystal beaches, maybe we even discover something of our own. :)</p>

As one of the kids celebrated her birthday, he made sure she had a great evening with presents and fun."

                        With the help of your skipper, and the weather forecast, you choose what you want to see, how long you want to navigate each day, and if you stay overnight in a Marina or at a buoy in a small bay."</p>
